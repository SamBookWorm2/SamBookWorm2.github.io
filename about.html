			<h1>My Story</h1>
			<p>
				Hi, Iâ€™m Sharon and  a web developer in training.  I have worked for many years in the health and education fields and found that the greatest obstacle to achieving set targets is lack of appropriate tools. For example, at my last appointment where I taught adult students one problem I encountered was access to additional information and practice questions in order to be properly prepared for assessments. I pointed them to different reading sources but found providing them with enough practice geared to their areas of weakness meant alot of paper  and more time than I had  to provide adequate individual assistance combined. So I figured that  if I could get all the pertinent additional help in one place, information along with quizzes and comments, I could more easily target the students who really need more individualized attention plus have a bank of additional scores automatically graded and entered in a mark sheet.  Hence a web developer in training: My goal is to create such a website that even my most educationally and technology challenged students can navigate, access the required assistance and build good grades.
